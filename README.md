# programming_formalisms_small_project

[The Small Project](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/blob/main/learning_line.md#functions-to-be-developed-for-the-small-project) 
in [the Programming Formalisms course](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms).

This repo does not use a formal testing framework,
as the focus of this part of the course is to do many iterations of TDD.
In [The Medium Project](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/blob/main/learning_line.md#functions-to-be-developed-for-the-medium-project)
there will be a formal testing framework.
